<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Sound of Emotion project combines cutting edge technology, leading science, eclectic music and artful execution.   The installation entices community to interact and collaborate by creating musical compositions, based solely on the participant's facial expressions. This unique experience recently delighted and amazed participants at its initial unveiling during the Market Street Prototyping Festival.
<p>The installation incorporates four iPads. Each iPad represents a single musical instrument and is installed with expression recognition software, courtesy of <a target=foo href="http://www.emotient.com">Emotient, Inc.</a>  Participants step up to the installation, see a mirror image of their own face and their musical instrument begins to play.  The iPad screen display encourages them, to display happy or sad emotions, thus changing the phrase or pitch for their instrument. Participants may build on the overall composition, by inviting friends or onlookers to participate, with the goal of playing all four instruments at once.
