<h2>Project Overview</2>
<p>The Sound of Emotion project entices community to interact and collaborate by creating sound and music, based solely on the participant's facial emotions.   This unique experience will delight and amaze participants, as well as observers. 
<p>The installation will incorporate four iPads, configured in a rectangular array.  For the selected musical genre, each device will represent a single instrument or sound, with each participant/iPad adding a supportive instrument (e.g. iPad 1: didgeridoo, iPad 2: bata drum, iPad 3: hand-held percussion, iPad 4: bells).
<p>The "instruments" will be played (triggered) through each iPadâ€™s proprietary emotion detection and sentiment analysis software, provided by Emotient, Inc.  The software recognizes up to seven unique emotions from facial expressions.  When an individual walks up to the device, they see their own face and the instrument begins to play.  If the individual smiles and shows positive emotion, the resulting phrase will be light and airy.  Should the person shift to a sad or negative emotion, the change in phrase or pitch will be sudden and noticeable. 
<p>This blog will be updated regularly to follow the creation of this prototype.  Stay Tuned!
