<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Can you imagine four complete strangers walking up to a street installation and collaborating on music together using only their emotions?  That was the repeated theme for three successive days at San Francisco's Market Street Prototyping Festival!  Garnering rave reviews, 
<blockquote style="font-size:125%;font-style:italic;width:200px;float:left; margin:0;">
  <p>"This is amazing!"<br>"I'm truly blown away"<br>"Favorite prototype on the street.."</p>
</blockquote>
The Sound of Emotion project delighted and amazed participants at its initial unveiling.  This unique installation combines cutting edge technology, leading science, eclectic music and artful execution.  View participant reactions on the <a href="gallery/index.html">Gallery</a> page).</p>

<p>The installation incorporates four iPads. Each iPad represents a single musical instrument and is installed with expression recognition software, courtesy of <a target=foo href="http://www.emotient.com">Emotient, Inc.</a>  Participants step up to the installation, see a mirror image of their own face and their musical instrument begins to play.  Each iPad screen display provides feedback on their happy or sad emotions, while changing the musical phrase or pitch for their instrument. Participants may build on the overall composition, by inviting friends or onlookers to participate, with the goal of playing all four instruments at once.
