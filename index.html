The "Sound of Emotion" project entices community to interact and collaborate by creating sound and music, based solely on the participant's facial emotions.   This unique experience will delight and amaze participants, as well as observers.  The project embodies the most compelling virtues that San Francisco represents; cutting edge technology, artful execution, compelling group interaction and the attraction of diverse community.

The installation will incorporate four iPads, configured in a rectangular array.  For the selected musical genre, each device will represent a single instrument or sound, with each participant/iPad adding a supportive instrument (e.g. iPad 1: didgeridoo, iPad 2: bata drum, iPad 3: hand-held percussion, iPad 4: bells).

The "instruments" will be played (triggered) through each iPad’s proprietary emotion detection and sentiment analysis software, provided by Emotient, Inc 1.  The software recognizes up to seven unique emotions from facial expressions.  When an individual walks up to the device, they see their own face and the instrument begins to play.  If the individual smiles and shows positive emotion, the resulting phrase will be light and airy.  Should the person shift to a sad or negative emotion, the change in phrase or pitch will be sudden and noticeable.  The installation will initially work with two emotional states, positive and negative.  Additional emotions will be captured and sounds and music will be added as time allows.  Each iPad screen will also have the ability to display feedback on the user’s emotional state via graphics (refer to screen mockups).

The installation will occupy a footprint of eight square feet (four * two) and approximately seven feet tall.  Each iPad will be encased for weather and damage protection.  The viewing height of each device will be easily adjustable by the participant, from 48" to 72", making it accessible for youth and individuals using a wheelchair.  The center of the installation will encase additional electronics, including an amplifier and speaker.  The installation will incorporate an "attract" mode, set to run continuously.  The project will operate well within specified power and decibel limitations.

Installation Goals:
- The installation shall be friendly, approachable and intuitive for participants to use without written or verbal instructions.
- The installation shall interactively engage from one to four people for a period ranging from 20 seconds, up to 240 seconds (four minutes).  It shall also provide an inquisitive and positive draw for any number of bystanders who watch the activities.
- The installation shall attract and engage groups of friends, as well as bring together complete strangers to engage in a shared and positive experience. 
- The installation shall work continuously (within designated hours) without the need for administrative or technical assistance.
- The installation shall be age friendly and wheelchair accessible, so it is possible for any individual to participate, from youth to adult.
