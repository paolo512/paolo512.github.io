I saw the Market Street Prototyping Festival (MSPTF) call for entrants as a perfect incentive to create conceptual art with the goal of aligning diverse groups of people.  There were significant challenges for many of the designs that we contemplated; budget, functionality and unknown weather conditions, etc., but perhaps the most daunting was creating something that we believed would be compelling enough to attract and retain the denizens of Market Street for some period of time.

These days my artistic leanings assert that "mixed media" should include some form of technology.  A foundation of low and high tech possibilities were considered, but it made sense to leverage the team's direct connection to one specific emerging company with truly cutting edge technology.  The company, Emotient (emotient.com) was formed by a group of scientists from the Machine Perception Lab at University of California, San Diego.  They offer "accurate facial expression detection and analysis that detects and tracks primary expressions of emotion, overall positive and negative emotions and blended composites of multiple emotions."  Very cool stuff.
