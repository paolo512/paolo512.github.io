title: "Brainstorming Ideas that Led to “The Sound of Emotion”"

I saw the Market Street Prototyping Festival (MSPTF) call for entrants as a perfect incentive to create conceptual art with the goal of aligning diverse groups of people.  There were significant challenges for many of the designs that we contemplated; budget, functionality and unknown weather conditions, etc., but perhaps the most daunting was creating something that we believed would be compelling enough to attract and retain the inhabitants of Market Street for some period of time.

<h3>Early Days - Overall Direction</h3>
These days my artistic leanings assert that "mixed media" should include some form of technology.  A foundation of low and high tech possibilities were considered, but it made sense to leverage the team's direct connection to one specific emerging company with truly cutting edge technology.  The company, Emotient <a target=foobat href=http://www.emotient.com>(emotient.com)</a> was formed by a group of scientists from the Machine Perception Lab at University of California, San Diego.  They offer "accurate facial expression detection and analysis that detects and tracks primary expressions of emotion, overall positive and negative emotions and blended composites of multiple emotions."  Very cool stuff.

<h3>Rough Concepts</h3>
Starting with the tech foundation (running on an iPad) and the goals gleaned from MSPTF and various sites, we started brainstorming to see what was feasible.  Here are some of the better ideas that surfaced:
<ul>
<li)A relationship guru for couples, centered around the participant's expressions (interesting, but fraught possible strife.. thrown out early for many reasons).
<li>A mystic figure, capable of describing the participant’s mood (may be compelling once and for a short period of time – jettisoned).
<li>A tour guide, capable of understand if the participant is confused, happy or otherwise about the offered suggestions (interesting…).
